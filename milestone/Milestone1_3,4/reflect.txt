1.Structure type can define a group of variable as a single object. In this milestone, 
there are three user defined types Name, Address, Numbers.
Struct can contain these three type that I createted. By holding three other struct as data members,
 it can be more easier to write code than not using struct.
When I called each address such as name, address and numbers, I used '&contacts.name' 
This is much simpler than I didn't hold three types struct as a single one. 
Also if there are more than one members, It can be more difficult and confused, so it needs to be struct. 

2. Passing array is the elements of an array occupy locations in memory. this accessing element from within a function 
only required the address of the start of the array.  It means when passing the address, we avoid copying 
the entire array. In this milestone, I used 'getName(struct Name *name)' instead of Contacts.
I didn't need to point to type Contacts as an argument, because Contacts type structed three types, 
and one of the types called Name has one argument. '*name' is the address of the start of the array. 

3. In this milestone, I learned how to make header file in seperate file and also how to call the new functions added in the project.
Pointer and function are difficult for me to understand,so I'd better practice harder.
