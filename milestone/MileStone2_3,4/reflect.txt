      1.When I was making getTenDigitphone function, I needed to get only numerical digits from input.
It was hard to me since I didn't know how to do it, but I found that It has to use Ascii table.
Ascii table made code to be more easy to determine range of numbers, so that I could define to get only numerical digit.
Using getTenDigitphone function made more easier to get from users only numbers. Also It was defined only 10 degits.
     
      findContactindex function is to find exactly the same information from users and displayed. I used strcmp library to compare 
two parameters, so that I could find the contact if the all contact are matched. Using findContactindex function,
It helps to find contact that user is looking for. If I didn't use this function, I should have declared many logics.
I think these two functions help my code readability.

2. I don't know much about programming languages, so I'm not sure whether including functions like this is good or not.
I could say these useful functions helped to organize coding readibility and save the contact information from users.
I think I liked this asssignment to include the functionality to save the contact information as a bigennier.
