Assignment: 1
Milestone:  2


  1.  I think it is possible to enter information all together not separately. 
For example, Please enter there first name and last name. Between two of them ,there will be space, 
so that we can recognize first name and last name. Also the other things that I can think of there is 
no need to ask optional things. we can ask question first, and then if user put nothing, just moved 
to next question and not save anything.


2. The differences between C string and character array is that C string has the null terminator 
the end of the array and the value is 0.  The number of memory location occupied by a string is 
one more than the number of characters in the string. If you use specifier “%s” primitive character array, 
It will shows unnesessary things.
