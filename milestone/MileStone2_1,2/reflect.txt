Assignment: 2 
Milestone:  2

1.Functions transfers control between one another. When a function transfers control to another function,
 it called the other function. It makes separate coding of each component and assembly  of various components 
into a complete program. In this milestone, there are 2 headers and 3  main function.
 After finishing this assignment, I learned how to use function appropriately.
 Now I am ready to combine another function as well.
I think these function will be needed to another languages. The C language is a procedural programming language,
 I don’t know much about other languages, but I think they also needed to combine different function to complete programs.

2. I guess the reasons why “helper” functions are in a different module is that “contact” contains 3 functions 
such as  name, address and number already. If “contacts” are in the “helper”function, It will be confusing 
to recognize and hard to see the code.
