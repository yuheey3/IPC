Subject Title
Introduction to Programming Using C


Subject Description

This course covers the fundamental principles of computer programming, with an emphasis on problem solving strategies 
using structured programming techniques. The C programming language, which is widely used and forms the syntactical basis 
for object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, and Java, is used to introduce problem analysis, algorithm design, and program 
implementation. Students work in a cross-platform environment.


Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

1.Design functions using selection and iteration constructs to solve a programming task

2.Connect functions using pass-by-value and pass-by-address semantics to assemble a complete program

3.Design collections using arrays and structures to manage data efficiently

4.Code algorithms using standard library functions to incorporate existing technology

5.Stream data using standard library functions to interact with users and access persistent text

6.Trace the execution of a procedural program to validate its correctness 

7.Code complete programs using appropriate object and pointer types to solve programming problems

8.Explain the purposes of procedural programming features to inform business persons
