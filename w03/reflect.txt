1. I think using pseudo-coding is very useful and helpful, because It helps to organize my code that
I have to make and also it is easy to determine the order of code. sometime I can add something after making pseudo-code.

2.There are 3 Iteration constructs. while, do while an d for. I used  for and do while.
I though for is easiest one than other. It can make just one line everything are in the on line is 
attractive for me. And also do while , it is executes it sequence at least once, I used this when 
I print out some sentences first. And I checked condition after that. 

3. This workshop was interesting but also difficlut for me, because I had to declare many things and 
when set the day number, I had to make this +1, because I used array, It started from 0, 
so I made day number +1 to make correct day. It was confused for me at first, but now I understand it.
