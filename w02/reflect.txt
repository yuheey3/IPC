 Ilearned many things in this worshop. Firstly, I learned how to use casting. It is allow to change from 
one data type to another data type. Secondly, I could used appropriate logical expression. Especially, 
I used  modulus and multiple a lot. It helped me to make the code more easily. 

I found casting interesting, because if the left operand ranking is more highier than the right operand, 
the right operand was changed automatically. Also I restudied Mixed-type expressions.
 On the other hand, understanding how to round up the balace owing was hard for me.

I think convert floating-point values to integers is the best practice, because when we code something, we will use that 
often and also while making reminder, we have to change from floating-point to integers.

 I think using modulus operator is the best practice, because we can use different types of opetators and we can know 
concept of types exactly.
