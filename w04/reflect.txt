1.Using array is very useful, because large collections of data can be organized in structure and the some type of 
variable can stored contiguously in memory.
Alternative of array is that you have to declare all variable you need. You have to type all you need. It is waste of time and memory.  

2. The good things of using  parallel is that It’s better and convenient when you store data of the same type and size.
 There is no memory overflow when you use array. The bed thing is that you can only enter fixed number of elements. 
Changing the size of the array is difficult.

3.We set the variable count to zero before the loop starts, then we write  loop to run through the list of numbers. 
Initialize iterator variables is important ,because in the array ,index numbering starts at 0.
