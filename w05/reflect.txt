  1.An array and a structure type are can collect  types on at a time, but  sometimes structure type is more useful 
when  you want to collect different types of variables. In this workshop, I needed to use structure type than parallel array, 
because I had to declare integer for Id, age and double type for salary. If I chose parallel array, I should have made two different array,
It would be inconvenient. By using structure type, I could collect employee information at the same space of memory.

  2.I could declare structure type similar to parallel arrays it can make one member holds the key, while the other member holds the data. 
If I use this, I can write employees’s Id, age and salary the same place in the code. And also when removed employee information,
there is still space and when I add the information again, it went exactly the same place. I think I could make this reorder the items ,
but I didn’t. I made the items to be 0.
